Description
===========
LaunchpadMacroizer is a personal project of mine that turns an old Launchpad MIDI 
controller that I rarely use into a powerful and customizable productivity tool. 

This project is not meant for public adoption, rather simply as a showcase piece
of my work. This code is *not* portable, and was never intended to run on any machine except my own.
Clone, run, and modify at your own risk and discretion.

Features
========
* Create custom macro profiles that can execute multi-key keystrokes or run commands
* Export and import profiles from disk
* Assign an application a certain profile, so that the assigned profile 
    automatically appears on the board when said application is in focus
